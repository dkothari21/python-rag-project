Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Basics
=====================================================

What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
Artificial Intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence by computer systems. AI systems can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.

Types of AI:
1. Narrow AI (Weak AI): Designed for specific tasks like Siri, Alexa, or image recognition systems.
2. General AI (Strong AI): Hypothetical AI that can understand and learn any intellectual task a human can. This does not yet exist.
3. Super AI: Hypothetical AI that surpasses human intelligence. This is purely theoretical.

What is Machine Learning (ML)?
Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Instead of writing rules, you provide data and let the algorithm find patterns.

Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning: The model learns from labeled data (input-output pairs).
   - Examples: Email spam detection, image classification, price prediction
   - Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks

2. Unsupervised Learning: The model finds patterns in unlabeled data.
   - Examples: Customer segmentation, anomaly detection
   - Algorithms: K-Means Clustering, PCA, DBSCAN

3. Reinforcement Learning: The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.
   - Examples: Game playing (AlphaGo), robotics, autonomous driving

What is Deep Learning?
Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that uses artificial neural networks with many layers (hence "deep"). It excels at processing unstructured data like images, text, and audio.

Key Deep Learning architectures:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Excellent for image processing
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Good for sequential data like text and time series
- Transformers: The architecture behind modern language models like GPT and Gemini

What are Large Language Models (LLMs)?
LLMs are deep learning models trained on massive amounts of text data. They can generate human-like text, answer questions, write code, and perform many language tasks.

Popular LLMs include:
- Google Gemini: Google's most capable AI model
- GPT-4: OpenAI's advanced language model
- Claude: Anthropic's AI assistant
- Llama: Meta's open-source language model

What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?
RAG is a technique that enhances LLM responses by providing relevant context from external knowledge bases. Instead of relying solely on what the model learned during training, RAG:

1. Takes the user's question
2. Searches a knowledge base for relevant documents
3. Provides those documents as context to the LLM
4. The LLM generates an answer based on both its training and the provided context

Benefits of RAG:
- More accurate and up-to-date responses
- Reduces hallucinations (made-up information)
- Can work with private or specialized data
- No need to retrain the entire model

RAG Components:
1. Document Loader: Reads documents from various sources (PDF, text, web)
2. Text Splitter: Breaks documents into smaller chunks
3. Embedding Model: Converts text chunks into numerical vectors
4. Vector Database: Stores and indexes the vectors for fast retrieval
5. LLM: Generates the final answer using retrieved context

What are Embeddings?
Embeddings are numerical representations of text (vectors). Similar texts have similar embeddings, which allows us to find relevant documents by comparing vector distances.

For example, "dog" and "puppy" would have similar embeddings because they are semantically related, while "dog" and "car" would have very different embeddings.

Vector Databases
Vector databases are specialized databases designed to store and query embeddings efficiently. Popular vector databases include:
- ChromaDB: Open-source, runs locally, great for prototyping
- Pinecone: Cloud-based, production-ready
- Weaviate: Open-source with cloud option
- Qdrant: Open-source, high performance
