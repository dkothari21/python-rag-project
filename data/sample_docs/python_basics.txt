Python Programming Basics Guide
================================

What is Python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It emphasizes code readability and simplicity, making it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced developers alike.

Variables and Data Types
Python has several built-in data types:
- Integers (int): Whole numbers like 1, 42, -7
- Floats (float): Decimal numbers like 3.14, -0.001
- Strings (str): Text enclosed in quotes like "Hello, World!"
- Booleans (bool): True or False values
- Lists (list): Ordered collections like [1, 2, 3]
- Dictionaries (dict): Key-value pairs like {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}

Variables in Python don't need explicit type declarations. You simply assign a value:
name = "Alice"
age = 30
is_student = True

Control Flow
Python uses indentation to define code blocks. The main control flow statements are:

If-Else Statements:
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult")
elif age >= 13:
    print("You are a teenager")
else:
    print("You are a child")

For Loops:
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # Prints 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

While Loops:
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1

Functions
Functions are reusable blocks of code defined with the 'def' keyword:
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

message = greet("Alice")
print(message)  # Output: Hello, Alice!

Functions can have default parameters:
def power(base, exponent=2):
    return base ** exponent

Lists and List Comprehensions
Lists are one of Python's most versatile data structures:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.append("date")  # Add an item
fruits.remove("banana")  # Remove an item

List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists:
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
even_numbers = [x for x in range(20) if x % 2 == 0]

Dictionaries
Dictionaries store key-value pairs:
person = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}

# Accessing values
print(person["name"])  # Alice
print(person.get("age"))  # 30

# Adding new key-value pairs
person["email"] = "alice@example.com"

Error Handling
Python uses try-except blocks for error handling:
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
finally:
    print("This always runs")

Object-Oriented Programming
Python supports OOP with classes:
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed

    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Woof!"

my_dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")
print(my_dog.bark())  # Buddy says Woof!

Modules and Imports
Python has a rich standard library and supports importing modules:
import math
print(math.pi)  # 3.141592653589793

from datetime import datetime
print(datetime.now())

Virtual Environments
Virtual environments isolate project dependencies:
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux
myenv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
pip install package_name
pip freeze > requirements.txt

File Handling
Python makes it easy to work with files:
# Writing to a file
with open("output.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello, World!")

# Reading from a file
with open("output.txt", "r") as f:
    content = f.read()
    print(content)
